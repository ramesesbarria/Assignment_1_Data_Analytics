    "# **Procedures in the Journal: Balanced Risk Set Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Risk Set Matching**\n",
    "- When a patient receives treatment at time **T**, they are matched with another patient who:\n",
    "  - Has a **similar history of symptoms** up to time **T**.\n",
    "  - Has **not received treatment up to time T**.\n",
    "- This ensures that patients being compared had comparable symptoms before treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:**  \n",
    "- Traditional matching uses baseline covariates only.  \n",
    "- **Risk Set Matching** matches patients dynamically at the time of treatment, **never using future data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Defining the Matching Problem as an Optimization Task**\n",
    "- The problem is modeled as a **minimum-cost flow in a network** (graph-based optimization).\n",
    "- **Goal:** Among all balanced matchings, pick the one that minimizes the **Mahalanobis distance** between treated and control patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. Define a **set of patients (nodes)**:\n",
    "   - **Treated group (patients who received treatment)**\n",
    "   - **Control group (patients not yet treated at that time)**\n",
    "2. Define **edges** between treated and untreated patients.\n",
    "3. Assign **costs** to edges using **Mahalanobis distance** between patients.\n",
    "4. Solve for the best **pairwise matching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Balanced Matching Using Integer Programming**\n",
    "- Matching should **balance covariates** across groups to avoid bias.\n",
    "- **Binary variables** are introduced:\n",
    "  - \\( B_{pk} = 1 \\) if treated patient \\( p \\) has covariate \\( k \\).\n",
    "  - \\( B_{ek} = 1 \\) if control patient \\( q \\) has covariate \\( k \\) at the time of matching.\n",
    "- Integer programming ensures:\n",
    "  - Covariate distributions are **identical** in both groups.\n",
    "  - Among all balanced matchings, the one with **minimum Mahalanobis distance** is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation**\n",
    "- **Objective Function:** Minimize total Mahalanobis distance within matched pairs.\n",
    "- **Constraints:**\n",
    "  1. Each treated patient is matched to one untreated patient.\n",
    "  2. The sum of covariate distributions in treated and control groups must be **equal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Sensitivity Analysis for Hidden Bias**\n",
    "- Observational studies may have **hidden biases** (unobserved confounders).\n",
    "- The study models the probability of treatment assignment using a **proportional hazards model**:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  h(t) = e^{\\beta X + \\gamma U}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  - \\( X \\) = observed symptoms  \n",
    "  - \\( U \\) = unobserved confounders  \n",
    "  - \\( \\gamma \\) = sensitivity parameter (how much hidden bias might affect results)\n",
    "- **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** is used to analyze differences in outcomes between matched pairs.\n",
    "- The study evaluates **how sensitive results are to potential hidden biases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Statistical Tests and Outcome Analysis**\n",
    "1. **Compare Matched Groups**  \n",
    "   - Use Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare symptom scores before and after treatment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Conduct Sensitivity Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Check if hidden biases could impact results.\n",
    "   - Simulate small variations in the data and recompute results.\n",
